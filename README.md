# Welcome to the Countdown application!

This application is a simple timer app that will count down from a set time and alert you when the time is up. You can set the timer for any amount of time up to 99 hours.

To get started, open the application and enter the desired time in hours, minutes and seconds. Once you have entered the time, press the Start button to begin the countdown. The timer will begin counting down and you will be alerted when the time is up.

If you need to pause the countdown, simply press the Pause button. You can resume the countdown at any time by pressing the Resume button.

Thank you for using the Countdown application!
